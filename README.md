# Simple Selector Plugin for OwlCarousel2

In updating several sites from jQuery 2.x to 3.x, legacy installations of the Owlcarousel plugin have stopped allowing one to simply target some DOM element, but rather *require* that the ".owl-carousel" class be attached to the target.

This change requires a fair amount of potential work to convert the markup and JS (depending on how you wish to add and remove the class).

## Installation / use

Simply include the /dist/owl.simpleselectorplugin.js file _after_ you've included owl-carousel's source.
